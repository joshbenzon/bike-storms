# Scatter Plot 

## Why did you pick this representation? 
- I chose this representation because I broadly wanted to show the relationship between two (three, if you count taxi and bike duration separately) continuous numerical variables. I wanted the viewer to get a sense of the data, the concentration, major outliers, etc. 

## What alternative ways might you communicate the result? 
- Instead of showing the diagram, we could just write out that there was a slight positive correlation between trip duration and temperature.

## Were there any challenges visualizing the results, if so, what where they? 
- I did not have challenges visualizing the results. I used a viridis color map for the colors to make the map more accessible. I also used larger font for the labels.

## Will your visualization require text to provide context or is it standalone (either is fine, but ## it’s recognized which type your visualization is)?
- I think this visualization could work standalone, but you would have to know the general context of our project to really understand it deeply. As such, it will require text to provide context.

# Line Plot

## Why did you pick this representation? 
- I wanted to show the seasonal/weekly patterns within the bike and taxi data, so I graphed them against dates to contrast them. You can see that there are cycles seasonally as well as weekly. I'm sure if our data went deeper, we would see daily cycles as well.

## What alternative ways might you communicate the result? 
- I could use a linear regression model to fit the line better to the datapoints if I wanted users to focus on the larger seasonal patterns, but I thought it would be fun to show the very granular weekly cycles as well.

## Were there any challenges visualizing the results, if so, what where they? 
- One challenge was figuring out how to get the x ticks to display only monthly dates instead of all the two years worth of dates.

## Will your visualization require text to provide context or is it standalone (either is fine, but it’s recognized which type your visualization is)?
- This visualization could stand alone. I think it's nice to have the background of our project for it though.
